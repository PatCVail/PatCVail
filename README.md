# Patricia Vail
Plant Molecular Biology PhD Student 

I am fascinated with understanding the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress in plants, how resistance evolves, and how to apply biotechnology tools to enhance plant adaptation. After working for Inari, an agricultural gene editing company, I decided to pursue a PhD with the Sloan lab at Colorado State University.
